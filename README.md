What a lovely morning, let me check my emails to start the day 

![phishing 0](https://github.com/BigTreeT/Detecting-and-analyzing-Live-phishing-/assets/157978941/340e8fdb-9d76-434b-90b7-455a97ee2568)
![phishing 0,1](https://github.com/BigTreeT/Detecting-and-analyzing-Live-phishing-/assets/157978941/1d341507-a566-4225-aa3f-b06a79fa8a84)

 Wow! A job offer with room for advancement and whats this?! I only have TWO DAYS TO APPLY!? I better have some URGENCY

A a shallow virustotal report indicates its probably alright but to be safe we open our VM to check out the url link

5600$ a month Seems a bit too good to be true... 

We will use Phishtool and Url.io to further our investigation

![phishing 5](https://github.com/BigTreeT/Detecting-and-analyzing-Live-phishing-/assets/157978941/ce65040b-a268-419f-bc98-c227619f1498)

The return path goes to a different adress, the domain was registered less than a month ago and was only renewed for three months.

At this point we can be confident that this is a phishing email most likely looking to extract data from victims via the application form or request payment at a later date in the name of job security.
